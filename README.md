# gushify
Python CLI tool to manage big torrent dump folder


### Description

Gushify is a small CLI tool which aims at helping managing downloaded torrents,
in three different ways/steps from a glob of .torrent files

1. Torrent file search and binding. This step will look in the torrent glob,
and it will match the torrents with the storage directory using file name,
size and optionally md5 (if available)
2. Sorting and restructuring downloaded data. This will move downloaded files,
according to the torrent matched in step 1, and put them under the right directory.
This will also generate a `metadata.json` file for each torrent with several infos.
3. Torrent client data generation. Once it has finally moved all data, it can
generate config for clients, using btresume data.
